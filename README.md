# Flutter Demo Class

## Task Objective

We need to build an app with both stateless and stateful widgets.

### Challenge 1: Create a Stateless Widget:

Create a static display widget (Text widget showing your name).

### Challenge 2: Create a Stateful Widget:

1. Create a Text widget that contains a number (for example 10).
2. Build an interactive button widget below the created Text widget. The button should change the state of the number in the above Text widget when pressed and increment it in order to define your age.

### Challenge 3: Makes everythings perfect!

1. Build another interactive button widget below the first one. The button should change the number when pressed and decrement it in order to fix the number if you have incremented it more than you require to define your age.
2. Prevent the first button from incrementing the number above 65 and the second button from decrementing the number below 10.
